            developer, I have embarked on a journey to master various foundational
            technologies essential for web development. My current skill set includes
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, which I've acquired as a beginner.

            further to build responsive and visually appealing websites. My ultimate
            goal is to leverage my MCA education alongside my web development
